                        <p style={{color: '#FFF', paddingLeft: '15px', fontFamily: 'Atma'}}>Our story began with a pivotal moment in the life of our co-founder, Sakshi. As a new mom navigating the exciting yet chaotic journey of parenthood, Sakshi found herself facing a common challenge shared by many parents: toy clutter. With the arrival of her bundle of joy, Sakshi quickly realized that her home was becoming overrun by a vast assortment of toys, each vying for space and attention.</p>

                    <Grid item container xs={12} md={8} sx={{color: '#FFF',  paddingLeft: '20px'}}>
                        <p style={{fontSize: '25px'}}>Determined to find a solution, Sakshi turned to her brother, Siddharth, for support. Together, they embarked on a mission to reimagine the way families approach playtime. Drawing from their own experiences and fueled by a shared passion for simplicity and sustainability, Sakshi and Siddharth joined forces to create <span style={{color: '#E30613'}}>Toy</span><span style={{color: '#4F4FD2'}}>Pebble</span>.</p>
                        <p style={{fontSize: '25px'}}>What started as a solution to a personal problem has since blossomed into a pursuit to redefine playtime for families. Together, Sakshi and Siddharth are on a mission to empower parents, inspire children, and create a future where every family can enjoy the benefits of play without the burden of toy clutter. Our toy rental service offers families a convenient, affordable, and sustainable way to enjoy a rotating selection of high-quality toys. From educational toys that spark curiosity to imaginative playsets that inspire creativity, our curated collection has something for every child's unique interest, and developmental stage.</p>
